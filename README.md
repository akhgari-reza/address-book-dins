# Test
1. Write a program that passes specified requirements;
2. Write unit tests for the written code;
3. The following technologies should be used: Java (8 versions or higher), Spring Boot, JUnit. Databases should not be used
4. Must be provided: the source code of the program, unit tests, instructions for starting the program, examples of calling REST methods of the program.
5. It is good to pay special attention to the REST specification and organization of REST methods.

`(GET) http://localhost:8080/dins/users/searchByLastName/{lastName}/`

* Add a new user to the list:

`(POST) http://localhost:8080/dins/users/addNewUser/`

* Remove a user from the list:

`(DELETE) http://localhost:8080/dins/users/deleteUserById/{id}`

* Get all contacts in the address book of a selected user by id:

`(GET) http://localhost:8080/dins/contacts/findByUser/{userId}/`

* Find a specific contact in the address book of a selected user by id:

`(GET) http://localhost:8080/dins/contacts/findById/{userId}/{contactId}/`

* Add a new contact to the address book of a selected user by id:

`(POST) http://localhost:8080/dins/contacts/{userId}/new/`

* Remove a contact from the address book of a selected user by id:

`(DELETE) http://localhost:8080/dins/contacts/delete/{userId}/{contactId}/`

* Update a contact in the address book of a selected user by id:

`(UPDATE) http://localhost:8080/dins/contacts/update/{userId}/{contactId}/`

* Find a specific contact by phone number:
